It is going to allow me to have a testing tool to use whener I feel the need.


- Decided to install PHPUnit into the project.
- Issued
```
    $ brew update
    $ brew upgrade composer
    $ composer init
```
- Using PHPUnit ^5.1.
```
    $ composer update
```
- Made a Tests folder.

- Added a .profile file.
- Added a local 'test' alias.
- Done.
